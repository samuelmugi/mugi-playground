/**
 * QUESTION 1.Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.
 *
 * A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
 *
 * Notice that the input string may contain leading or trailing spaces. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
 *
 * Also, notice that you need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
 * Your function should have input of the string to be reversed and it should return the reversed string.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: s = "the sky is blue"
 * Output: "blue is sky the"
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: s = "  hello world  "
 * Output: "world hello"
 * Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: s = "a good   example"
 * Output: "example good a"
 * Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
 * Example 4:
 *
 * Input: s = "  Bob    Loves  Alice   "
 * Output: "Alice Loves Bob"
 * Example 5:
 *
 * Input: s = "Alice does not even like bob"
 * Output: "bob like even not does Alice"
 *
 * Constraints for input s:
 *
 * 1 <= s.length <= 104
 * s contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces ' '.
 * There is at least one word in s.
 * code template
 *
 * function reverseString($s)
 * {
 * $new_str="";
 * ------
 * YOUR CODE HERE
 * -------
 * return $new_str;
 * }
